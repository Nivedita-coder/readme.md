  ## Community Programs
  
  ### Mentoring
     - SIG/WG determines need
     - Consults with sig-contribex; contribex sets up infra (slack channel; TODO build this out)
     - Posts a note to their mailing list and k-dev that they are looking for more
       reviewers/approvers/x_role and would like to form a group to mentor who are
       already in the role below it. (example: already a member and they need more
       reviewers)
     - Sets a start date and end date; schedule a kick off meeting so everyone can
       meet
       over video/audio (1 and only unless the group establishes other comms). Also set
       the weekly slack standup days so they are consistent.
     - Program begins
     - If the mentors think certain skills will need to be taught/learned, they
       should be done upfront. (We scattered them for the first cohort and there were
       things that would be been more valuable to learn in the beginning of the
       journey)  
     - Feedback is continuous*
     - Mentors start PRs for those who graduated
      *Feedback is continuous but will have a half way check in point. The goal is that
       mentees should not be surprised by the outcome of the program.


- Resources from SIG Contributor Experience
  - Swag
    - The Project can provide you with K8s tshirts, stickers, and other
      marketing materials.
    - If someone in your SIG is doing a great job and you want to recognize them
      a tshirt is a great way to do that, especially for folks unable to attend
      conferences.
    - K8s baby onesies are also available but usually take longer.
    - In most cases we need to sync with that person's employer so that we can
      send them swag without having to manage people's private information, so
      please sync with SIG Contributor Experience as early as reasonably
      possible.
    - Silly gift practical jokes or anything involving googly eyes that make
      people smile will be given the appropriate level of priority.
- Resources from the CNCF - TODO
