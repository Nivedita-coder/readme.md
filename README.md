  ## Community Programs
  
- Mentoring, succession planning, and staffing - TODO
- Resources from SIG Contributor Experience
  - Swag
    - The Project can provide you with K8s tshirts, stickers, and other
      marketing materials.
    - If someone in your SIG is doing a great job and you want to recognize them
      a tshirt is a great way to do that, especially for folks unable to attend
      conferences.
    - K8s baby onesies are also available but usually take longer.
    - In most cases we need to sync with that person's employer so that we can
      send them swag without having to manage people's private information, so
      please sync with SIG Contributor Experience as early as reasonably
      possible.
    - Silly gift practical jokes or anything involving googly eyes that make
      people smile will be given the appropriate level of priority.
- Resources from the CNCF - TODO
